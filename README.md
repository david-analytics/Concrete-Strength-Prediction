# Concrete-Strength-Prediction

This project aims to predict the durability performance of Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) to assess its feasibility and suitability in sustainable construction practices. The concrete data dataset was used in this analysis and obtained from the Kaggle website. It includes approximately 1030 instances and 9 features. The concrete compressive strength is a regression problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.
